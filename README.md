# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview
"Surfs Up," the surf shop is seeking to expand and Oahu, Hawaii is on the shop owner's radar as a potential location. In addition to offering surfing gear, there would be an ice cream shop included with the expansion.

We have already determined that the average annual weather conditions for Oahu are good, but we specifically want to know if operating the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year round.

There are concerns that June and December weather conditions are a risk to operating year round, so lets analyze the weather data found in hawaii.sqlite.

## Objective
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Results

### June Temperature Statistics

The following are the temperature statistics for June

- Average temperature is 74.94 degrees
- Maximum temperatures reach 85 degrees
- Minimum temperatures are as low as 64 degrees
- The temperature is 77 degrees or higher for one week out of the month of June

### December Temperature Statistics

The following are the temperature statistics for December

- Average temperature is 71 degrees
- Maximum temperatures reach 83 degrees
- Minimum temperatures are as low as 56 degrees
- The temperature is 74 degrees or higher for one week out of the month of June

## Summary

December is typically one of the coldest months in the year ranging from 56-69 for one week out of the month.  These colder weather days may limit sales of ice cream, but could drive up business for the needs of wetsuits and other gear.

June presents some of the hottest days in the month ranging from 77-85 degrees. This will boost ice cream sales on these hotter days.  

I also decided to analyze the amount of precipitation Oahu, Hawaii receives in June and December.  From the data we can conclude that in June, majority of precipiation is less than .12 mm vs December where they average .15 mm of rainfall a day.  This is not a varying difference in rainfall averages between the two months.

After analyzing the temperatures and rainfall for the two risky months at Oahu, Hawaii we have deteremined there is minimal threats to opening up this shop and operating the business year round.
